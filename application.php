    <p>It took me a year and a half to get the system working properly.  This was do to my college schedule.  I worked on the project during the summer and winter breaks.  The system even went through a complete redesign.</p>

    <p>The first design did not have a way to pick up the film and used the film sprocket to pull the film over the scanner.</p>

    <p>The second design fixed this problem by motorizing the pickup spool and using the film sprocket as a frame counter.</p>

    <p>Hardwood was used a building material, because it is easy to cut with readily available tools.  I actually built the second design completely out of Plexiglas first, but found it to hard to control tolerances while cutting.  It looked cool though.</p>

    <p>I used Lego gears in the gearbox.  Lego has been making the same gears for decades and you can get a set of gears directly from Lego, so I didn't have to scavenge my old toys for parts.</p>

    <p>I used a motor from an obsolete bubble jet printer.  Luckily, it had a pulley already attached.</p>

    <p>I made the film rollers out of nylon spacers and washers.</p>

    <p>I gutted a standard 8mm and Super8 projector to get the film sprockets and spool holders.</p>

    <p>The gearbox is controlled manually by the red button or serially by the computer.  The motor can be switched to run in either direction.</p>

    <img data-full-size="images/sprocket-switch.jpg" alt="sprocket cam switch" src="images/sprocket-switch-thumb.jpg" />
    <p>One revolution of the sprocket is detected by the gearbox by using a cam and switch.</p>

    <p>The circuit board supplies the 5 V to the motor and to the serial communication.  The serial communication receives the run and stop signals from the computer and also broadcasts every revolution of the film sprocket back to the computer.  The serial communication activates the relay to turn the motor.</p>

    <p>The other side of the scanner has a film holder that lets the film unroll easily.</p>

    <img data-full-size="images/scanner-open.jpg" alt="scanner with lib open" src="images/scanner-open-thumb.jpg" />
    <p>The scanner is able to scan film because of the built in transparent media adapter.</p>

    <img data-full-size="images/film-guide.jpg" alt="the film guide removed from system" src="images/film-guide-thumb.jpg" />
    <p>I built a guide using blank transparency slides, a &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign, foam, and clear tape.  It holds the film flat against the glass and allows light to pass through.</p>
