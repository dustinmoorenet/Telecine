    <h3>Problems</h3>
  </header>
  <p><strong>When I stated that the system works,</strong> I was not lying, but I have decided not to use it to transfer my film collection for several reasons.  First, the scanner I bought for the system has given me nothing but trouble.  I have to automate the scan operation using keystroke micros, because HP does not open up the scanner's full capabilities to TWAIN support.  I can scan, but I can not turn on the transparent media adapter.  Also, the scans of the film are too dark.  I can fix this by cheating the light calibration before the scan, but it does not produce consistent results.  Finally, the scanner was not designed to be used as much as I need it to be, and occasionally, the scanner jams as it makes a pass.  The first problem greatly complicates and slows down scanning and the last two cause an unpredictability that I can not accept.</p>
  <p><strong>The second reason the system will not be used,</strong> is that the process of scanning and moving the film requires that the film be dragged across glass and plastic.  This might damage the film.  I tried to devise a system that didn't require as much contact, but the designs only complicated the system further.</p>
