    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  </header>
  <p><strong>I greatly enjoyed designing and building the system.</strong>  It was a big learning experience, especially in the area of image manipulation.  I even built my own class to build, edit, open and save bitmap files, before I learned that the code to manipulate image files has already been throughly written.  Even though the system is not reliable, I do not consider the project a failure.  In fact, I consider it one of the greatest projects I have ever been apart of.</p>
